IoT\\
each device is identified with a public key\\
to store and manage data collected by IoT devices, in a decentralized and private-by-design fashion.\\
we decide to work with etherum following the adivce:"To conclude: We believe that the most secure approach is to develop Io Tapplications on top of an already existing stable blockchain, where PoW and the great number of honest miners ensure integrity, and avoid that misbehaving miners can obtain a large portion of computational power."\footnote{B for IoT: systematic literature review}\\

blockchain for social impact: methodology\footnote{Stanford Business School, Center for Social Innovation, 2018, Blockchain For Social Impact Moving Beyond The Hype}:\\
1-what is the problem of your organization is trying to solve? What are your end users?\\
2-How does your initiative use blockchain, and why is blockchain a good technology for this problem?\\
3-What technologies or services are available to solve this problem, and how is blockchain a better solution?\\
4-what is your initiative's intended impact? How do you measure it?\\
5-In what time do you think you will see meaningful impact from your blockchain initiative?\\
